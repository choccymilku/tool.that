you want this? here's a tutorial how to deploy this repository yourself:

# what you'll need to get started
1. basic knowledge of html, css and javascript 
2. various api keys (spotify, soundcloud, discord, lastfm, pronouns.page)
3. your own service for back-end apis and web deployment

# getting started
1. fork the website and api repositories to your local machine and your github account

2. edit to your liking (config.js for website, .env.example for api) (rename to .env)

3. deploy api (i'd recommend hop.io for this)

4. authorize your accounts to the api by accesing these endpoints: /discordauth, /soundauth and /spotifyauth (this step is crucial, otherwise nothing will work, like at all.)

5. run the website locally, check if everything is working correctly

6. deploy your website, use either cloudflare, vercel of hop for this

# it won't work
check if you've done everything correctly, if issue persists, dm me on discord and I'll be happy to help you (please dm me immediately rather than wait for me to accept your request.)
